      The trouble in eastern Ukraine began in 2014. Then-president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in a "color revolution" that brought a pro-Western government to power in Ukraine. The Crimean region voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia in a referendum. The "Donetsk People's Republic" and "Luhansk People's Republic" were declared after clashes broke out between militias and Ukrainian government forces in the Donbass region, where Donetsk and Luhansk prefectures are located.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">
      The conflict in eastern Ukraine reached internationally brokered ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. Since then large-scale armed clashes have been contained, but skirmishes have broken out.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">
      Biden has taken a tough line on Russia since taking office, supporting Ukraine's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and increasing military aid to the Ukrainian government. In this context, the Ukrainian government has said that it will "take back" Crimea by force and end Russia's "aggression" in eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">
      Since November, the Ukrainian and U.S. governments have said that Russia has amassed a large number of troops along its border with Ukraine and could "invade" Ukraine. The US government has been ramping up the "Russian threat" of an imminent "invasion" of Ukraine.

      <p class="w3-large">
        The Russian side has repeatedly denied the "invasion", stressing that NATO activities threaten Russia's border security. On December 15, Last year, Russia submitted to the United States and NATO respectively the draft bilateral security assurance agreement, the Russian side of the security demands of the proposal, including NATO to stop further eastward expansion, commitment not to include Ukraine as a member, the United States will not establish military bases on the territory of non-NATO member states of the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">

On The same day, Putin criticized the West for ignoring Russia's "fundamental concerns" about NATO's eastward expansion.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">
        Meanwhile, the U.S. government has stepped up military assistance to Ukraine. In December, the Biden administration approved an additional $200 million in security assistance to Ukraine. On January 24, NATO decided to send more troops, ships and aircraft to its eastern European members. On February 2nd the US announced that it would deploy a total of 3,000 troops to Germany, Poland and Romania.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">

On January 17, Russian troops arrived in Belarus to take part in a combat readiness inspection of the Rapid reaction Force of the Russia-Belarus National Union. Russia and Belarus kicked off the "Alliance Resolution-2022" joint exercise in Belarus on February 10.
        European countries have sought to de-escalate the situation by conducting shuttle diplomacy while demanding that Russia withdraw its troops. At the end of January, France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine resumed the "Normandy model" talks. In early February, French President Emmanuel Macron visited Russia and Ukraine, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited the United States, Ukraine and Russia.
