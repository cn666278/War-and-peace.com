	Hi, here is Chen Nuo, the designer of war and peace.com.

	The website you can directly open it under the folder "war and peace": war and peace/assignment1.html,
	or open it with XAMPP(copy the folder "war and peace" to C:\XAMPP\htdocs)

	This website is designed and developed by me during 20 May-22 June 2022,
	for course CST310 Mutimedia Technology only.

	War and Peace.com based on the theme of war and human, aims to inspire readers to think about the relationship 
	between war and peace by presenting some historical materials, pictures and arts of human wars in modern history.

	Many thanks for lecturer Miss. Norma Liyana Binti Omar for her teaching me with such a lot knowleadge about 
	front-end programming, which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP..

	I personally prefer front-end programming to boring back-end programming,
	because I think it's imaginative and full of design rather than just plain old code and algorithms. 

	In 2021, I participated in XMUM Hackathon and learned myself Figma for prototype design.

	After that, I followed my mentor to conduct the Flutter programming project. Later, I got to know HTML, CSS
	and PHP through the course CST310. 
	
	I think I have already seen my future direction on this road, which is also a road I am willing to fight for.
	
	I really appreciate all kinds of friends and mentors I met along this way.

	Chen Nuo,
	22 June, 2022
