      The Syrian civil war is an armed conflict between supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian revolutionary opposition that has been going on since 2011. Influenced by the Arab Spring, anti-government demonstrations in Syria in early 2011 turned into armed conflict, involving the United States, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Arab countries and other domestic and foreign forces. The Syrian civil war has lasted for more than a decade, resulting in at least 380,000 to 500,000 deaths, the second deadliest war in the 21st century, only second to the Second Congo War [85]. A United Nations report says both Syrian government forces and rebels committed war crimes including murder, extrajudicial killings, torture and other abuses.</p>

      <h4 class="w3-center">The Long War</h4><br>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-large">
      In early 2011, anti-government demonstrations in Syria quickly spread to many parts of the country, and clashes between demonstrators and security forces gradually escalated. With the help of western countries (especially the United States) and Sunni states, the Syrian opposition demanding the ouster of Alawite President Bashar al-Assad quickly grew and formed its own forces, and the conflict against the regime eventually turned into a civil war that has continued to this day. </p>
      <p class="w3-large">The representative political organizations of the Syrian opposition are the National Coalition of Syrian Opposition and Revolutionary Forces and the Syrian Interim Government, while the main armed organizations are the Free Syrian Army. The Arab League and the Gulf, as well as the 57-state Islamic World Group, expelled The Assad regime and recognized the Syrian opposition as the legitimate representative. On the other hand, islamist armed groups with strong religious elements, Islamic terrorist groups including THE Islamic State, and Kurdish armed groups seeking to get rid of foreign domination also took the opportunity to rise in Syria. As many as 1,000 Syrian rebel groups are believed to exist, according to a December 2013 report. Sporadic clashes between some rebel groups have added to the chaos.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">While the rebels have been flooded with foreign aid, Iran and Russia have heavily backed the Syrian government, turning the civil war into a tug of war between Sunnis and Shiites and between the U.S. and Russia. Then it evolved into direct U.S. and Russian military involvement in Syria. The Russian military began airstrikes against Syrian rebels on September 30, 2015. The United States announced air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria in September 2014, and repeatedly bombed Syrian government military facilities, but later by mistake or direct denial to prevarication. On April 7, 2017 (Shayrat strike in 2017) and April 14, 2018, the United States and other countries directly announced and attacked Syrian government military facilities.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Although the Syrian government forces were briefly bombed by western countries for several times, with the support of Russia and Iran, they gradually stabilized their positions, took the initiative in the war and controlled an expanding area. Since 2017, the Syrian government forces have recaptured a large number of areas formerly controlled by the Syrian opposition, including Aleppo province, Hama Province, Homs Province and Deraa Province, and defeated THE Islamic State and regained a large area of territory in eastern Syria</p><br>
