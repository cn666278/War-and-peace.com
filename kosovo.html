      <p class="w3-large">
        The Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, in March 1998 after the Drenica massacre in February 1998, when Serbian police began raids against the KLA in the Drenica area due to frequent attacks by the KLA on Serbian officials.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">
        In January 1999, the Lachak massacre took place against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and Kosovo Albanians. Western nations blamed the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for the massacre. Then NATO stepped in and drafted the Rambouillet Agreement, hoping to resolve the dispute through peaceful negotiations. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia refused to sign the agreement, and the agreement was not reached.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">
        On March 23, 1999, U.S. Special Envoy to the Balkans Richard Holbrooke announced the failure of the peace talks. When Bill Clinton's administration ended diplomatic efforts and began air attacks against the confederates, the Confederates responded with a massive invasion of Kosovo and an even more brutal policy of ethnic cleansing, driving albanians out of the country and creating the largest refugee influx in Europe since World War II. After 78 days of bombardment, the Confederacy suffered considerable losses. The war took place from 24 March to 10 June, when Albanian guerrillas continued to fight the Serbian government with force as NATO attacked Serbian-Montenegro targets. During this period, the population of Kosovo was greatly reduced.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">
        On March 28, 1999, NATO began the second phase of its air campaign, shifting its focus to attacks on KPA ground forces and military supplies south of latitude 44 degrees NORTH in an attempt to disrupt the South's war machine and force the Confederates into submission.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">
        On April 13, 1999, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced the third phase of the air campaign against the Confederacy, expanding the scope and increasing the intensity of the air campaign. NATO bombarded all military targets in the TERRITORY of Yugoslavia 24 hours a day; On the other hand, in order to weaken the will of the People of Yugoslavia to resist, NATO also bombed the civilian facilities of Yugoslavia, such as Bridges, railways, roads, factories, television stations, communication systems and electricity systems. In addition, the United States is sending ground troops and Apache attack helicopters to the Balkans to prepare for a ground offensive.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">
        On May 7, 1999, five joint direct attack guided bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists, injuring a few diplomats and destroying the building. This incident is called the May 8th Incident in China, and then the 1999 Anti-American demonstrations broke out in mainland China.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">
        On June 2, 1999, confederate President slobodan milosevic accepted by Russia's envoy chernomyrdin, Finnish President martti ahtisaari, deputy secretary of state of talbot make joint peace agreement, the agreement on the original rambouillet plan basic content at the same time, emphasize the necessity to solve the problem through the UN mechanism, and make specific provisions. Under the agreement, a multinational force in Kosovo will be established in accordance with the spirit of the UN Charter, the exact nature of Kosovo's future autonomous status will be determined by the UN Security Council, and arrangements for the return of refugees will be implemented under the supervision of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>

      <h4 class="w3-center">Ending</h4><br>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-large">
        Forced by the powerful military intervention and threat of NATO led by the United States, Milosevic finally accepted the conditions set out by NATO, the KOSOVO Liberation Army must disarm, stop military operations. Yugoslavia withdrew its troops from Kosovo, allowed the Albanians to go home and rebuild their homeland under the supervision of UN peacekeepers, and the Kosovo war ended. Serbia has since lost control of Kosovo, but maintains its sovereignty to this day.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">
        Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 488 civilians have been killed as a result of NATO airstrikes. August 2000 The Former South Korean War Crimes Tribunal (ICTY) reported in August 2000 that 2,788 bodies had been exhumed, many of them likely victims of war crimes. According to the KFOR, 2,150 were found in July 1999, of which 850 were believed to be victims of war crimes. In July 2001, Serbian authorities reported the discovery of mass graves for 1,000 people, the largest in Batajnica. Human rights groups put the number of people killed in serbia-Montenegro war crimes at 4,400. The ICTY puts the final death toll from Serbian crimes at 10, 000.</p>
